            Hi, my name is Chatmongkhonchai Reabroi, my nickname is Nasa.
            I'm from Thailand I have been in the USA for almost 8 years but my enlish skills atill not very good but it's ok for communication. 
            I'm 25 years old I graduated from Kaukauna High SChool in 2019. For now I have full-time job and Study in FVTC in the same time that's the reason why I'm still not graduated from FVTC yet.
        </p>

        <p>To be honest I never think about learn this much coding in my life but I choose this courses because it's said "Webdesign". 
            then my mind just think about I want do something I can work with my computor and desing in the same time.
        Until now I still not very good at it but I always have fun when I know something new and it's give me more idea about what I can do it the Webdesign.</p>
